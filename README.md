# webclientexp
A CTF-style challenge on client-side exploitation, a critical security vulnerabiliy in most website designs. 

With client side, the user can input the string and invoke a reponse. In this case, the website invokes a Javascript function that when entered reveals the flag.

Rule of good web design: Always use server side validation, never client side!

Excellent for ctf-based contests/challenges.
